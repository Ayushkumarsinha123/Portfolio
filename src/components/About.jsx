            <p>
              Hello! I'm Ayush Kumar Sinha, a 3rd-year student at Roorkee
              Institute of Technology with a strong passion for web development
              and building user-friendly digital experiences. I enjoy turning
              ideas into clean, functional, and responsive interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have fair
              knowledge of the MERN stack. I love working on real-world projects
              that challenge me to think creatively and improve my development
              skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me playing football, sketching,
              or relaxing with some anime and movies. These hobbies keep me
              inspired and energized as I continue to grow as a developer.
